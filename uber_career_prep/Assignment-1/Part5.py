Part 5: Reverse a Linked List

Implement reverseLinkedList() which takes in a linked list and returns a new linked list with the same elements in
reverse order. For example, if the representation of your Linked List is “1, 2, 3, 4”, then reversing it would return
“4, 3, 2, 1”.
We have identified three main methodologies for achieving this solution, and we want to challenge you to build all
three:
    1) Iteratively
In this context, “iteratively” means “looping through the data set”. Therefore, our solution should have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
    2) Using a stack
Leaning on our knowledge of stacks, can you think of a way to utilize a stack to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n)?
    3) Recursively
Read up on recursion, and then apply that knowledge to come up with another version of this algorithm.
